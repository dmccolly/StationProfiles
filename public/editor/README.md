## Tips & Best Practices

### Image Optimization
- Use web-optimized images (JPEG for photos, PNG for logos)
- Keep file sizes under 1MB for faster loading
- Use appropriate dimensions (300-600px width is usually ideal)

### Content Structure
- Use headers to organize content into sections
- Keep paragraphs concise and readable
- Use lists for multiple related items
- Add images to break up long text blocks

### Text Wrapping
- **Float Left/Right**: Great for magazine-style layouts
- **Center**: Best for featured images or logos
- **Inline**: For small icons or inline graphics

### Styling Consistency
- Use similar image styling across all stations
- Maintain consistent header hierarchy
- Keep color schemes professional
- Use shadows sparingly for emphasis

### Mobile Considerations
- Test how images look at different sizes
- Avoid very wide images (max 600px recommended)
- Use responsive text sizes
- Keep layouts simple and clean
