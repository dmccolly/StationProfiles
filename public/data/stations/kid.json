The FCC officially deleted the license on March 3, 2023.3 Despite the cessation of the AM facility, the \"KID Newsradio\" brand and its conservative talk programming continue to operate, sustained exclusively through two essential FM translators: KIDJ (106.3 FM, serving Idaho Falls/Rexburg) and KIDG (92.1 FM, serving the Pocatello area).\n\nLicensing and Technical Profile of the Deleted Facility\n\nFinal Technical SpecificationsThe KID AM facility operated on the 590 kHz frequency, broadcasting with a significant maximum daytime power of 5,000 watts.3 Due to regulatory mandates necessary to prevent interference with other stations operating on the same channel, such as KUGN 590 AM in Eugene, Oregon 4, KID was required to employ a directional antenna pattern and severely reduce its power to only 1,000 watts during nighttime hours.3The directional transmission infrastructure was located at a site near Iona, Idaho.1 This directional array was essential for balancing the station's need for regional coverage with its obligation to protect co-channel signals.Table: KID 590 AM Final Technical Profile and DispositionParameterDetailsFrequency (AM)590 kHzCity of LicenseIdaho Falls, IdahoPower Profile (D/N)5,000 W / 1,000 WFinal OwnerRich Broadcasting (Rich Broadcasting Idaho LS, LLC)License SurrenderedFebruary 23, 2023B. Continuation via FM TranslatorsThe station’s current operational model highlights the technological shift in the radio industry. The AM programming is now reliant upon its two existing FM translators.1 This strategy ensures signal consistency, particularly after sunset, when the AM signal was drastically reduced, and allows the talk format to reach listeners who prefer the clarity and portability of FM reception. The brand’s vitality now rests entirely on these higher-quality FM delivery platforms: KIDJ (106.3 FM) and KIDG (92.1 FM).\n\nStation History and Ownership Evolution\n\nThe Pioneering Era (1928-Mid 1970s)The facility first launched in December 1928 as KGIO.2 Following a brief period of operation, the call letters were changed to KID two months later. For decades, KID served as the dominant radio station in Idaho Falls, utilizing the promotional identity “The KID with a punch!”.2 Early documentation indicates that KID Broadcasting Co., Inc. held the license during this time.5KID's historical importance was further magnified in 1953 with the establishment of KIDK-TV (Channel 7, later 8/10), which originated as an extension of the radio property.\n\nThe co-management of these assets established KID as a formidable media power across the entire Idaho Falls market.6B. Ownership Transitions and Format Change (1980s-2010)\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, the station transitioned its programming toward a dedicated talk radio format.  Ownership subsequently moved through several large corporate entities, including GapWest Broadcasting, which was ultimately absorbed into Townsquare Media in August 2010.3 This period reflects the broader trend of consolidation occurring across the American radio landscape.C. Rich Broadcasting Era and License Deletion (2011-2023)\n\nIn 2011, Rich Broadcasting acquired the Idaho Falls–Pocatello cluster from Townsquare Media, maintaining the conservative talk programming.1 The end of the 590 AM license was precipitated by a critical failure of infrastructure in November 2021, when a farmer accidentally severed a guy wire, causing one of the directional array towers at the Iona site to fall, abruptly taking the station off the air.  The crisis deepened when Rich Broadcasting attempted to resolve the issue. According to Rich Mecham, the company's president, a legal dispute arose with the landowner, who claimed ownership of the tower and received the insurance payout.  Subsequently, the landowner demolished the two remaining towers, removed all broadcasting equipment, and destroyed the transmitter building.1This situation created an insurmountable financial obstacle. Mecham calculated the cost of rebuilding the entire directional antenna system, which involved multiple towers, the transmitter building, and securing a new lease, at between $1.5 million and $2 million.  Given the decreasing financial viability and technical difficulties associated with the AM format, management determined that the expense was too significant to justify. This demonstrates the harsh economic reality facing high-maintenance AM facilities today, where the technical cost of sustaining a directional signal, especially in the face of asset destruction, can extinguish a legacy brand, forcing its migration to more cost-effective FM assets.\n\nRich Broadcasting made the strategic choice to surrender the license in February 2023, preserving the brand name solely on FM.1IV. Format and Programming HistoryA. The Heritage Full-Service EraIn its early years, KID offered a diverse, full-service format characteristic of commercial radio before television dominance. Programming included local news, radio theater, and various musical styles. This format fostered numerous local stars.Notable historical programming included the Early Bird Show with Bob Burtenshaw and Higham and Eggs with Leo Higham. Later, the station targeted youth with Beat, a late-night rock program hosted by Bill Hatch in the late 1960s, known for his deep voice and liberal use of microphone reverb.\n\nContemporary Conservative TalkThe modern format is built upon conservative talk radio, catering to an audience seeking alternative perspectives to mainstream media.  The lineup features established national syndicated personalities: Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Lars Larson, Jimmy Failla, Ben Shapiro.  This structure employs national content to attract a core audience, while critical local programming maintains market relevance. The Jolyn Thomas Show serves as the primary local vehicle.\n\nKey Talent and Personnel\n\nBob Burtenshaw: Host of the Early Bird Show; his popularity extended beyond broadcasting, as he later served as a legislator in the Idaho House.2Leo Higham: Co-host of Higham and Eggs.  Bill Hatch: Influential late-night rock DJ.  Jack Sunday: Known for providing coverage during the critical 1976 Teton Dam failure.  \n\nModern Talent and Management\n\nJolyn Thomas: Host of the station’s vital local morning program, The Jolyn Thomas Show, responsible for high-volume engagement with local politicians and thought leaders. Jimmy Failla: A popular nationally syndicated host who frequently interacts with the local brand, presenting events and making in-studio appearances. Rich Mecham: President of Rich Broadcasting, who managed the station's portfolio through the crisis and the subsequent license surrender.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Public ServiceKID Newsradio maintains a profound commitment to local public affairs and community events, which is critical to its business model following the loss of its heritage facility.\n\nFocus on Local Governance and DiscourseThe station's strategy is evident in the depth of its local talk programming, including regular segments such as Jolyn's Interviews, The Justice Shuffle, and Table Talk.This commitment ensures the brand remains indispensable to the Idaho Falls/Pocatello civic structure.Examples of local political and civic content include: Legislative and Political Coverage: Interviews cover detailed state issues like school choice, freshman legislator experiences, and local attorney analysis of national events like the Trump sentencing. The station hosts election forums and provides comprehensive coverage, interviewing local political chairs and candidates from both major parties, promoting informed voter turnout. Community Issues: Discussions focus on specific regional concerns, such as Water Wars in Idaho, and efforts to protect Title IX.   Public Safety: Features include discussions with law enforcement, such as the Bonneville County Sheriff's Department Cold Case Task Force.  Cultural and Charitable Integration KID Newsradio actively partners with and sponsors community and charitable events. This deep local integration sustains the station’s heritage identity in the absence of its original AM facility. Support includes:Cultural Events: Media sponsorship for events like the Greater Idaho Falls Juneteenth CommUNITY Heritage Music Festival.  Charity: Promotions for the Idaho Heart Foundation’s Heart Ball, fundraising for local animal shelters, and the \"Pet for a Vet\" initiative.7Leadership Development: Providing a platform to highlight regional civic projects, such as the Greater Idaho Falls Chamber of Commerce's \"Emerging Leaders\" program. \n\nAnalysis: Strategic Resilience of Local Talk RadioThe continued relevance of the KID brand, despite the physical elimination of the 590 AM facility, illustrates a successful modern strategy for heritage talk stations. The core economic determination is to use the low cost and high profile of syndicated national hosts to subsidize intensive local news and public affairs content.This local specialization, particularly in covering detailed legislative updates and hyper-local elections, creates unique value that cannot be replicated by national media. By delivering this critical local content over the technically superior FM translators (KIDJ/KIDG), Rich Broadcasting maximized reach and signal reliability, while shedding the high operational costs and physical risk associated with maintaining the complex AM directional array. The station effectively transformed itself into an efficient, purely FM-centric information platform, proving that brand legacy can survive infrastructural failure if local community commitment is maintained through superior transmission technology.",
