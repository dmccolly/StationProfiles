  "fullContent": "KQFC 97.9 FM stands as one of Boise's most historically significant radio stations, representing over six decades of broadcasting evolution from its origins as KBOI-FM in 1960 to its current identity as \"Magic 97.9.\" The station's remarkable journey encompasses ownership by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through Boise Valley Broadcasters, multiple format transformations from beautiful music to country to its current soft adult contemporary programming, and its role as part of one of Idaho's most influential media operations. Licensed originally as the FM counterpart to the legendary KBOI AM, the station has weathered numerous ownership changes, call letter modifications, and format experiments while ultimately finding success as Magic 97.9 under current Cumulus Media ownership. From beautiful music \"quarter hour sweeps of mostly instrumental cover versions\" in the late 1960s through its extensive country music era as KQFC to its recent transformation into \"The Magic Is In The Music,\" the station exemplifies how heritage frequencies can reinvent themselves while serving changing audience demographics and market conditions. Under the programming leadership of veteran radio professional Lisa Adams, Magic 97.9 has established itself as a \"community-focused radio station playing a wide variety of music for adults from the past five decades,\" demonstrating how soft adult contemporary programming can succeed by emphasizing musical diversity, community engagement, and professional presentation. The station's ability to adapt while maintaining its essential role in Treasure Valley broadcasting illustrates the enduring value of local radio when executed with strategic vision and authentic community connection.\n\nORIGINS AS KBOI-FM AND CHURCH OWNERSHIP\n\nKQFC's broadcasting history began November 1, 1960, when \"the station signed on the air as KBOI-FM.\" The station served as \"the FM counterpart to KBOI,\" creating a dual-frequency operation that provided both AM and FM service under unified ownership and management.\n\nThe original ownership structure proved unique in American broadcasting, as the station \"was owned by Boise Valley Broadcasters,\" which \"was a subsidiary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\" This religious institutional ownership provided operational stability and community-oriented programming philosophy during the station's formative years.\n\nInitially, \"KBOI-FM mostly simulcast the full service, middle of the road format on KBOI, consisting of popular music, news and sports.\" This simulcast approach reflected common industry practice during the early FM era, when many stations used their FM frequencies to duplicate AM programming while building audience awareness for the superior audio quality FM provided.\n\nThe multimedia operation expanded significantly when \"KBOI-TV was also co-owned with KBOI-AM-FM,\" creating a comprehensive media enterprise that included radio and television under unified ownership. This integrated approach provided cross-promotional opportunities and shared resources that enhanced all operations' competitive positioning.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ownership ensured programming standards that emphasized family-friendly content and community service, establishing operational principles that would influence the station's character through subsequent ownership changes.\n\nBEAUTIFUL MUSIC ERA AND FORMAT INDEPENDENCE\n\n\"By the late 1960s, KBOI-FM broke away with its own beautiful music format,\" marking the station's first independent programming identity separate from its AM counterpart. This format change reflected FM radio's evolution toward specialized programming that utilized the superior audio quality for music presentation.\n\nThe beautiful music format featured \"quarter hour sweeps of mostly instrumental cover versions of popular songs, as well as Broadway and Hollywood show tunes.\" This programming approach served adult audiences seeking sophisticated, unobtrusive music suitable for background listening in offices, homes, and professional environments.\n\nBeautiful music programming required sophisticated music curation and technical presentation that showcased FM radio's audio advantages over AM broadcasting. The format appealed to educated, affluent adults who appreciated musical quality and programming without the commercial interruption and DJ chatter common to other radio formats.\n\nThe format change also demonstrated management's recognition that FM radio could serve distinct audience segments not adequately addressed by AM programming. This strategic thinking would prove essential for the station's long-term development and competitive positioning.\n\nDuring this era, the station established its identity as a quality music service that prioritized audio excellence and sophisticated programming over mass market appeal, creating brand characteristics that would influence subsequent format decisions.\n\nTRANSITION TO COUNTRY MUSIC AS KQFC\n\nJanuary 1, 1986 marked a transformative moment when \"the station switched its call sign to KQFC, flipping to a country music format.\" This strategic change reflected both country music's growing popularity during the 1980s and the need for programming that served broader demographic segments than beautiful music provided.\n\nThe call letter change to KQFC created a new brand identity that supported the country format while distinguishing the station from its previous beautiful music programming. The format change also reflected broader industry trends as FM radio increasingly captured audiences from AM competitors.\n\nThe country format required different programming expertise and on-air talent capable of serving country music's distinctive culture and audience expectations. This transition demonstrated the station's willingness to adapt to changing market conditions while building new audience relationships.\n\nCountry music programming provided opportunities for community involvement through concert promotions, festival sponsorships, and artist appearances that created deeper audience engagement than the previous beautiful music format allowed.\n\n\"Cory Mchals and Debi McCallister, longtime radio veterans, joined KQFC in August 2002 from the Monterey, California, radio market to host morning drive time.\" These experienced professionals brought market credibility and programming expertise that enhanced the station's competitive position in Boise's country music landscape.\n\nOWNERSHIP TRANSITIONS AND CORPORATE CHANGES\n\nKQFC experienced significant ownership changes that reflected broader consolidation trends affecting American radio. The station's ownership evolution included transitions through multiple corporate structures before arriving at its current Cumulus Media ownership.\n\nOctober 2011 brought a major transition when \"Cumulus took over the ownership of Citadel's Boise operations, placing KQFC under the same ownership as KIZN, one of its country music rivals.\" This ownership change created unusual competitive dynamics with two country stations under common ownership.\n\n\"The change in ownership meant cuts in KQFC's air staff, as McCallister and Burke were let go from their contracts as part of a reduction in workforce throughout the company.\" These personnel changes reflected cost-cutting pressures common to radio consolidation while potentially affecting programming quality and audience relationships.\n\nIndustry observers speculated that \"with Cumulus having two Country outlets in Boise, either KIZN or KQFC would be poised for a possible format flip in the future.\" This competitive situation created uncertainty about the station's long-term format direction while influencing programming decisions.\n\nThe corporate ownership changes provided access to national programming resources and operational efficiencies while potentially reducing local programming autonomy and community connections that distinguished successful country radio operations.\n\nNASH FM EXPERIMENT AND FORMAT EVOLUTION\n\nMay 24, 2013 marked another significant branding change when \"KQFC rebranded as Nash FM 97.9, using Cumulus' national branding for many of its country stations.\" This change connected KQFC to a broader network of country stations while potentially reducing local brand identity.\n\nThe Nash FM branding represented Cumulus Media's strategy for creating consistent brand identity across multiple markets while providing programming resources and promotional support that independent operators could not match.\n\nFebruary 2014 brought programming changes when \"the nationally syndicated America's Morning Show replaced the local Q Waking Crew with Cory Mchals after more than 10 years.\" \"Mikhals was relocated to co-owned KIZN,\" demonstrating the corporate restructuring affecting local programming continuity.\n\nApril 3, 2017 represented another format evolution when \"KQFC dropped the 'Nash FM' branding and flipped to a classic country format as '97.9 KQFC.'\" This change reflected continued experimentation with country music programming approaches while seeking optimal market positioning.\n\nThe multiple branding and format changes during this period demonstrated both the challenges of operating competing country stations under common ownership and the ongoing search for sustainable programming that could differentiate KQFC from sister station KIZN.\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION TO MAGIC 97.9\n\nOctober 11, 2019 initiated the most significant recent change when \"KQFC began simulcasting KIZN.\" This temporary arrangement preceded the major format transformation that would redefine the station's identity and programming approach.\n\nThree days later, \"KQFC dropped its longtime country format and flipped to soft adult contemporary as 'Magic 97.9.'\" This dramatic format change represented recognition that country music programming could not sustain two stations under common ownership in the Boise market.\n\nThe decision to adopt soft adult contemporary programming reflected strategic research, as \"The Soft AC format had scored sizable ratings in San Francisco and Seattle, leading Cumulus to try it in Boise.\" This approach demonstrated data-driven programming decisions based on successful format implementation in comparable markets.\n\nThe \"Magic 97.9\" branding positioned the station as \"The Magic Is In The Music,\" emphasizing musical programming over personality-driven content while appealing to adults seeking sophisticated music programming without aggressive commercial presentation.\n\nThis format change created \"a community-focused radio station playing a wide variety of music for adults from the past five decades,\" serving audience segments not adequately addressed by existing Boise market competitors.\n\nLISA ADAMS LEADERSHIP AND PROGRAMMING VISION\n\nThe Magic 97.9 launch coincided with the appointment of Lisa Adams as Program Director, bringing extensive experience and market knowledge that proved essential for successful format implementation. Adams represented \"a veteran radio programming professional with more than 25 years' experience.\"\n\nAdams's background included previous success in the Boise market, as she \"was previously Operations Manager/Program Director for Townsquare Media's Boise radio stations.\" This local experience provided valuable market intelligence and industry relationships that enhanced Magic 97.9's competitive positioning.\n\nHer recent experience as \"Program Director for Hubbard Radio's KNUC-FM in Seattle, WA, having programming other Seattle stations including KLCK-FM, KQMV-FM and KYPT-FM\" demonstrated expertise in markets similar to Boise while providing insights into successful soft adult contemporary programming.\n\nAdams also brought Portland market experience as \"Program Director for KXJM-FM in Portland, OR,\" providing additional Pacific Northwest programming expertise that aligned with Boise's demographic and cultural characteristics.\n\nThe appointment represented \"a return to Boise for Adams,\" creating personal investment in the market's success while providing continuity with her previous local radio experience and community connections.\n\nCURRENT PROGRAMMING AND FORMAT IDENTITY\n\nMagic 97.9's programming approach emphasizes musical diversity and quality presentation that distinguishes the station from more narrowly focused competitors. The soft adult contemporary format serves audiences seeking sophisticated music programming spanning multiple decades and genres.\n\nCurrent programming includes \"Lisa Adams in Mornings\" providing local personality programming that creates community connection while maintaining the format's emphasis on music presentation. Adams's dual role as Program Director and morning host ensures consistency between programming vision and on-air execution.\n\n\"Bret Connors in Afternoons\" provides continuity programming that maintained audience relationships through the format transition. Connors's retention demonstrates the station's commitment to preserving successful programming elements while adapting to the new format requirements.\n\n\"Mike Kasper with News in the morning\" provides information programming that enhances the station's community service while leveraging his extensive Boise market experience and audience relationships. Kasper's involvement connects Magic 97.9 to the broader Cumulus Boise operation while maintaining local programming focus.\n\nThe programming approach emphasizes \"a wide variety of music for adults from the past five decades,\" creating playlist diversity that serves broader audience segments than traditional adult contemporary stations while maintaining quality standards that appeal to sophisticated listeners.\n\nTECHNICAL OPERATIONS AND SIGNAL COVERAGE\n\nKQFC operates with technical specifications that ensure comprehensive coverage throughout the Treasure Valley and surrounding regions. \"Studios and offices are on West Bannock Street in Boise,\" providing centralized operations that support community involvement and promotional activities.\n\n\"The transmitter is off North Bogus Basin Road, amid other TV and FM towers, north of Boise,\" positioning the station's technical facilities for optimal signal propagation throughout the mountainous terrain of southern Idaho.\n\nThe transmitter location provides coverage that extends throughout the Boise metropolitan area while reaching rural communities and neighboring regions.
