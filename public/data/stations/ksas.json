  "fullContent": "KSAS 103.5 FM, branded as \"Kiss FM,\" stands as \"Boise's #1 Hit Music Station\" and serves as the Treasure Valley's premier Top 40/Contemporary Hit Radio destination. Licensed to Caldwell, Idaho, but broadcasting to the greater Boise metropolitan area, the station has carved out a dominant position in the competitive pop music landscape since its format transition in 2000. Currently owned by Townsquare Media, Kiss FM operates from studios at 827 East Park Boulevard, Suite 100, in Boise, sharing facilities with its sister stations in the Townsquare cluster. The station's tagline \"YOUR Home for Contests, Concerts and LIVE for 175\" reflects its deep community engagement, particularly its annual commitment to child abuse awareness through the \"Live for 175\" campaign that became synonymous with longtime personality Steve \"KeKe Luv\" Kicklighter. With its current programming featuring nationally syndicated shows like \"Brooke and Jeffrey in the Morning\" alongside local talent, Kiss FM continues to deliver the latest pop hits from artists like Bruno Mars, Katy Perry, and contemporary chart-toppers to a loyal audience throughout the Treasure Valley.\n\nSTATION HISTORY\n\nEarly Years and Format Evolution (Mid-1990s - 2000)\n\nThe frequency 103.3 FM (which would later become 103.5 FM) has experienced several format changes throughout its history. In the mid-1990s, the station operated with call letters KARO and featured an all-'70s music format branded as \"Arrow 103.\" This format lasted until 1997, when KARO switched to an Album-Oriented Rock (AOR) format, positioning itself to compete with other rock stations in the market including classic rock KKGL, active rock J105, and the alternative-leaning KQXR.\n\nThe Birth of Kiss FM (2000)\n\nIn 2000, KARO made a significant format change that would define its future success. The station flipped to Top 40/Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR) and became \"103.3 Kiss FM,\" marking the return of the Kiss FM moniker to the Boise market for the first time since the former CHR station KIYS had dropped the \"92 Kiss FM\" branding and switched to country as \"Kissin' 92\" (KIZN) ten years earlier. This format change proved to be strategically sound, as Kiss FM quickly established itself as formidable competition among the Treasure Valley's Top 40 stations.\n\nCompetitive Landscape and Format Dominance (2000-2013)\n\nFrom 2000 to 2013, Kiss FM faced competition from other Top 40 stations in the market, including Music Monster 99.1 (KTPZ operating as an all-'80s format) and 93.1 Hit Music Now (KZMG, now KBOI-FM). However, Kiss FM's strong programming and community engagement helped it maintain its position as the market's primary Top 40 station. During this period, both competing stations eventually exited the Top 40 format, leaving Kiss FM as the dominant contemporary hit radio station in the Treasure Valley.\n\nClear Channel Era and Corporate Changes (2006-2013)\n\nOn November 16, 2006, Clear Channel Communications announced plans to sell 448 of its radio stations outside the top 100 markets, including KSAS-FM and its Boise sister stations: KCIX, KTMY (now KAWO), KXLT-FM, KIDO, and KFXD. This made Boise the largest radio market in the United States where Clear Channel was divesting its stations. In March 2007, Peak Broadcasting LLC successfully acquired the Boise stations, including Kiss FM.\n\nUnder Peak Broadcasting's ownership, Kiss FM continued to develop its brand and community presence. The station maintained its Top 40 format and began to establish the promotional campaigns and community involvement initiatives that would become hallmarks of its identity.\n\nTownsquare Media Acquisition (2013)\n\nOn August 30, 2013, a significant ownership change occurred when Townsquare Media announced it would purchase Peak Broadcasting's stations, including KSAS-FM. This transaction was part of a complex three-way deal involving Cumulus Media's acquisition of Dial Global. As part of the arrangement, Townsquare swapped Peak's stations in Fresno, California, to Cumulus in exchange for Cumulus's stations in Dubuque, Iowa, and Poughkeepsie, New York. Peak Broadcasting, Townsquare Media, and Dial Global were all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management, which facilitated the multi-party transaction. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013.\n\nFrequency Change and KZMG Accommodation (2013)\n\nOn October 31, 2013, at exactly 5:00 PM, KSAS made a historic frequency change from 103.3 FM to 103.5 FM. This realignment was coordinated to allow for the return of KZMG to the Boise market, albeit as an adult Top 40 station on 102.7 FM. The frequency change was marked by symbolic programming choices: the last song played on 103.3 Kiss FM was \"Let The Children Play\" by local rapper Infectious, while the first song on 103.5 Kiss FM was \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, representing both continuity and a fresh start for the station.\n\nKEY PERSONALITIES AND PROGRAMMING\n\nSteve \"KeKe Luv\" Kicklighter Era\n\nPerhaps no personality has been more associated with Kiss FM's identity than Steve \"KeKe Luv\" Kicklighter, who joined the station in 2007 and became its most recognizable voice for nearly 15 years. Kicklighter initially hosted afternoon programming before transitioning to morning drive time, where he became known for his energetic on-air presence and commitment to community causes.\n\nRecord-Breaking Stunts and Community Awareness\n\nKeKe Luv made international headlines in April 2008 when he set an unofficial world record by staying awake for 175 consecutive hours while broadcasting live on the air. This marathon broadcast was strategically timed to coincide with the start of National Child Abuse Prevention Month, bringing significant attention to child abuse prevention efforts. The phrase \"it shouldn't hurt to be a child\" became deeply ingrained in the local consciousness through this and subsequent campaigns.\n\nIn April 2009, KeKe Luv continued his commitment to child abuse awareness by running seven marathons in seven days, further cementing his reputation as a personality willing to push physical and mental limits for important causes. These stunts evolved into the annual \"Live for 175\" event, which became a signature program for Kiss FM, combining entertainment with serious social advocacy.\n\nProgramming Transitions and Current Lineup\n\nIn June 2020, a significant programming change occurred when Townsquare Media made the decision to remove KeKe Luv and co-host Kat Fisher from Kiss FM's morning show. This change marked the end of an era for the station, as the nationally syndicated \"Brooke and Jeffrey in the Morning\" program replaced the local morning team. The decision represented a shift toward more standardized programming common among larger radio corporations.\n\nThe current weekday programming lineup features \"Brooke and Jeffrey in the Morning\" during morning drive time, followed by various dayparts hosted by local and regional personalities. The station has maintained its commitment to contests, concerts, and community engagement, though the local personality-driven content has been reduced in favor of more music-focused programming.\n\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CULTURAL IMPACT\n\nThe \"Live for 175\" Legacy\n\nThe \"Live for 175\" campaign became one of the most successful community awareness initiatives in Boise radio history. The annual event, which continued until 2019, transformed a highly-rated radio station into a platform for child abuse prevention advocacy. The campaign's success demonstrated the power of radio personalities to effect positive social change while maintaining entertainment value.\n\nContest and Concert Programming\n\nKiss FM has consistently positioned itself as \"YOUR Home for Contests, Concerts and LIVE for 175,\" emphasizing its role as a gateway to entertainment experiences for listeners. The station regularly features high-profile contests and provides access to concerts and events, maintaining strong relationships with the music industry and local venues.\n\nDigital Innovation and Mobile Apps\n\nRecognizing the changing media landscape, Kiss FM has invested heavily in digital platforms and mobile applications. The station's app allows listeners to stream live broadcasts, participate in contests, submit photos and videos, receive breaking news alerts, and access exclusive content. Features include Android Auto integration, weather forecasts, social media sharing capabilities, and Chromecast support for wireless streaming.\n\nTECHNICAL OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES\n\nBroadcasting Infrastructure\n\nKiss FM broadcasts from facilities at 827 East Park Boulevard, Suite 100, in Boise, Idaho 83712. The station shares this location with its Townsquare Media sister stations, creating operational efficiencies and collaborative opportunities. The main business line is 208-344-6363, with a dedicated studio line at 208-384-1035.\n\nCorporate Structure and Leadership\n\nUnder Townsquare Media's ownership, Kiss FM operates within a larger corporate structure that includes Market President Mike Owens, Brand Manager Mateo, Director of Sales Pete Mills, Digital Managing Editor Chris Pickett, and Promotions Director Andy Clements. This structure provides the station with resources and support while maintaining local market focus.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nThe station is licensed to Caldwell, Idaho, and operates on 103.5 MHz FM with sufficient power to serve the entire Boise metropolitan area. The technical facilities support both traditional broadcasting and digital streaming platforms, ensuring broad accessibility for listeners across various platforms and devices.\n\nCURRENT MARKET POSITION AND FUTURE OUTLOOK\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nAs \"Boise's #1 Hit Music Station,\" Kiss FM continues to compete in a dynamic radio market that includes various formats and both local and national programming. The station's focus on current hits, combined with its established brand recognition and community connections, helps maintain its position as the primary Top 40 destination in the Treasure Valley.\n\nTownsquare Media Integration\n\nAs part of Townsquare Media's portfolio, Kiss FM benefits from the company's resources, national advertising relationships, and digital expertise. Townsquare's focus on local market engagement aligns with Kiss FM's community-oriented programming philosophy, while providing access to nationally syndicated content and promotional opportunities.\n\nAdaptation to Changing Media Consumption\n\nKiss FM has demonstrated adaptability to changing listener habits by expanding its digital presence, developing mobile applications, and maintaining active social media engagement. The station's ability to balance traditional radio programming with digital innovation positions it well for continued success in an evolving media landscape.\n\nThe station's legacy of community engagement, combined with its musical focus and technological adaptation, ensures its continued relevance as a primary entertainment and information source for the Boise metropolitan area. While the departure of long-time personalities like KeKe Luv marked the end of an era, Kiss FM's brand strength and community connections provide a foundation for future growth and audience engagement."
