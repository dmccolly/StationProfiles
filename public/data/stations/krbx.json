  "fullContent": "KRBX 89.9 FM, known as Radio Boise, represents the democratization of radio broadcasting in the Treasure Valley\u2014a true community-powered station that has fundamentally challenged the traditional commercial radio model since its terrestrial debut in April 2011. Operating as an independent, non-profit community radio station, KRBX embodies the principle of \"people-powered radio that inspires, informs and builds community.\" What distinguishes Radio Boise from every other station in the market is its volunteer-driven programming model, featuring 65 live and original shows every week created by community members rather than professional broadcasters. Based in the basement of the historic Alaska Building at 1020 West Main Street in downtown Boise, this freeform radio station serves as both a cultural hub and a platform for voices that are systematically underrepresented in mainstream media.\n\nBroadcasting on both 89.9 FM (licensed to Caldwell) and 93.5 FM (downtown translator), plus streaming worldwide online, Radio Boise has evolved from an internet-only experiment in 2002 to become an essential component of Boise's cultural ecosystem, particularly through its deep integration with events like Treefort Music Festival and its commitment to showcasing local musicians, artists, and community voices.\n\nSTATION HISTORY\n\nThe Internet-Only Years (2002-2011)\n\nRadio Boise's story begins not in 2011 with its FM launch, but in 2002 when the Boise Community Radio Project first began as an internet-only broadcast. During these formative nine years, the organization operated from \"a humble room filled with patchwork audio gear and dedicated audiophiles sitting at the desk,\" as described in the station's own historical documentation. This internet-only period was crucial for developing the station's volunteer base, programming philosophy, and community connections that would later prove essential for its terrestrial success.\n\nThe vision was clear from the beginning: to provide \"a more democratic form of radio programming\u2014one that better reflects the character of our community.\" The founders recognized that existing radio options in the Treasure Valley were largely unresponsive to community concerns and lacked locally programmed content that represented the diversity of voices and interests in the region.\n\nDuring the internet years, Radio Boise developed its core programming principles:\n\u2022 Volunteer-driven programming reflecting community diversity\n\u2022 Support for local musicians and artists\n\u2022 Alternative perspectives on news and current events\n\u2022 Educational content on issues affecting the local community\n\u2022 A platform for underrepresented voices and viewpoints\n\nTechnical Development and FM Launch (2011)\n\nThe transition from internet-only to FM broadcasting represented a massive technical and organizational undertaking. The station's unique broadcast setup reflects both the challenges of operating as a low-power community station and the innovative solutions developed by Radio Boise's technical team.\n\nKRBX's main terrestrial transmitter is located in the Owyhee Mountains of eastern Oregon, with the city of license being Caldwell, Idaho. This unusual arrangement allows the station to serve the Boise metropolitan area while complying with FCC regulations and power restrictions. To ensure adequate coverage in downtown Boise, the station operates a translator (K228EK) on 93.5 FM, licensed to Garden City, providing stronger signal coverage in the urban core.\n\nThe technical infrastructure begins in the basement studios of the Alaska Building, where volunteer programmers broadcast from \"The Booth.\" Audio signals travel through the station's \"Rack Room\"\u2014a collection of computers and processing equipment that handles the incoming signals. The processed signal is then transmitted via STL (Studio-Transmitter Link) from a radio dish on the Alaska Building rooftop to the main transmitter site.\n\nEarly Programming Development (2011-2015)\n\nRadio Boise's initial terrestrial programming in 2011 established the freeform format that continues to define the station. Unlike commercial stations with tightly controlled playlists and demographic targeting, Radio Boise adopted a philosophy of programming diversity that reflected the varied interests and musical tastes of its volunteer hosts.\n\nEarly programming included:\n\u2022 Music shows spanning genres from indie rock to world music, blues to electronic\n\u2022 Public affairs programming including local news and community discussions\n\u2022 Arts and culture coverage featuring local artists and cultural events\n\u2022 Educational content on topics not covered by mainstream media\n\nThe station's commitment to local music became apparent early, with programs dedicated to showcasing Treasure Valley musicians and providing a platform for emerging artists. This focus on local music would later prove crucial to the station's integration with Boise's growing music scene.\n\nOrganizational Structure and Non-Profit Status\n\nRadio Boise operates under the Boise Community Radio Project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization established to manage the station's operations, fundraising, and community engagement activities. This structure ensures the station's independence from commercial interests while providing a framework for community support and volunteer management.\n\nThe organization is governed by a Board of Directors comprising community members who volunteer their time and expertise. Board members typically include individuals with backgrounds in law, healthcare, education, and other professional fields who share a commitment to community radio's mission. The Board meets monthly in the Alaska Center Boardroom to oversee strategic planning, financial management, and policy decisions.\n\nThe Treefort Music Festival Connection\n\nOne of Radio Boise's most significant relationships is with Treefort Music Festival, which began in 2012, just one year after KRBX's FM launch. This timing was not coincidental\u2014both organizations emerged from Boise's growing recognition of the need for platforms to showcase local music and culture.\n\nTreefort Music Festival's founders, including Eric Gilbert (who also hosts a show on Radio Boise), recognized the importance of having a local radio platform to support the festival's mission of celebrating Boise's music scene. Radio Boise became integral to Treefort through:\n\nLive Broadcasting: KRBX provides extensive live coverage of Treefort events, broadcasting directly from festival venues and conducting live interviews with performing artists.\n\nIn-Studio Sessions: The station's facilities host live, intimate performances by Treefort artists, giving listeners unique access to festival performers in a radio setting.\n\nCommunity Building: Both organizations share the goal of building connections between local and touring artists, helping to establish Boise as a recognized music destination.\n\nYear-Round Programming: Radio Boise continues to promote and discuss Treefort-related activities throughout the year, maintaining momentum between annual festivals.\n\nVolunteer Programming Model\n\nRadio Boise's volunteer programming model distinguishes it from every other radio station in the Boise market. The station currently features 65 live and original shows every week, each created and hosted by volunteer community members who receive basic training but are given significant creative freedom to develop their programming.\n\nTraining and Support\n\nNew volunteers participate in orientation sessions and technical training to learn station operations, FCC regulations, and Radio Boise's programming philosophy. The station provides ongoing support through:\n\u2022 Monthly volunteer meetings and social events\n\u2022 Technical assistance from experienced volunteers\n\u2022 Programming feedback and development\n\u2022 Community-building activities\n\nShow Development Process\n\nProspective hosts pitch show concepts to the Programming Committee, which evaluates proposals based on:\n\u2022 Consistency with Radio Boise's mission\n\u2022 Uniqueness within the current programming lineup\n\u2022 Host's commitment to regular broadcasting\n\u2022 Community relevance and interest\n\nApproved shows receive time slots based on availability and appropriateness for the intended audience. Shows can evolve over time, with hosts encouraged to experiment and develop their on-air personalities.\n\nKey Programming and Personalities\n\nWayne Birt - Program Director and Production Manager\n\nWayne Birt represents the continuity and institutional memory of Radio Boise, having been involved with the station since 2005 during its internet-only period. His background includes experience at Boise State University's student station KBSU in the 1980s and commercial radio at KIDO before joining the Radio Boise effort.\n\nBirt's role extends beyond traditional programming duties to include:\n\u2022 Production oversight for underwriting announcements and promotional content\n\u2022 Technical coordination ensuring FCC compliance and broadcast quality\n\u2022 Volunteer development providing training and support for new programmers\n\u2022 Show curation maintaining programming diversity and quality standards\n\nHis show \"Stray Theatre\" has been recognized as one of the station's standout programs, reflecting his deep knowledge of music and broadcasting. Birt holds an MFA in Creative Writing from Eastern Washington University and has published short stories, bringing literary sensibilities to his radio work.\n\nNichole Marie Albertson-Winkle - General Manager and Music Director\n\nNichole Marie's journey with Radio Boise exemplifies the station's community-building potential. After earning her BA in English Literature from the University of Idaho, where she DJ'd at KUOI, she discovered the then internet-only Boise Community Radio Project and immediately recognized its potential.\n\nHer progression through Radio Boise roles demonstrates the station's commitment to developing volunteer talent:\n\u2022 Initial volunteer during Radiothon fundraising events\n\u2022 Substitute host filling in for regular programming\n\u2022 Regular host of \"The Rapture\" Tuesday afternoon show\n\u2022 Music Director organizing the station's music library and acquisition\n\u2022 General Manager (as of May 2023) overseeing all station operations\n\nNichole Marie also hosts \"Bangers and Mashups,\" a Sunday night mix show that creates complex musical collages by blending multiple songs and genres. Her approach to programming reflects Radio Boise's experimental spirit and willingness to push creative boundaries.\n\nPersonal note: She met her husband at KRBX while recording promotional content, illustrating how the station serves as a genuine community-building space.\n\nCommunity Host Programs\n\nFrom the Basement: Radio Boise's weekly live music showcase, airing Fridays from 4-5 PM, features in-studio performances by local and touring musicians.
