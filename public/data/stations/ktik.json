  "fullContent": "KTIK 1350 AM, known as '95.3 The Ticket,' stands as Boise's premier sports talk radio station, serving the Treasure Valley with comprehensive athletic coverage and passionate local commentary. Broadcasting from 1419 W. Bannock Street in downtown Boise, the station has evolved into the heartbeat of Idaho sports culture, riding the wave of Boise State football's meteoric rise since the mid-1990s.\n\nUnder Cumulus Media ownership, KTIK operates as an Infinity Sports Network affiliate, delivering both local programming and national sports content. The station's flagship show, 'Idaho Sports Talk' with hosts Mike Prater and Johnny 'Ballgame' Mallory, represents the longest-running sports talk program in Idaho, cementing KTIK's position as the definitive voice for Treasure Valley athletics.\n\nThe foundation of KTIK's sports identity traces back to January 7, 1985, when Jeff Caves launched a variation of 'Idaho Sports Talk' on 630 KIDO with co-host Larry Polowski. This pioneering program eventually migrated to KTIK 1340 AM (later moving to 1350 AM), establishing the template for what would become Idaho's most enduring sports radio franchise.\n\nThe current iteration of 'Idaho Sports Talk' features Mike Prater and Johnny 'Ballgame' Mallory as the primary hosts, with the show airing weekdays from 3-6 PM. Mallory is described as 'among the most passionate, energetic and knowledgeable hosts in sports media' and is in his second stint as a radio host in Boise.\n\nThe show's production is handled by John Patrick (JP), who serves as producer and technical director, managing everything from sound drops for segments like 'Wheel of Games' to creating and editing video content for the station's YouTube presence.\n\nOn January 3, 2022, KTIK underwent another significant transformation when it rebranded as '95.3 The Ticket' after KTIK-FM switched to a simulcast of news/talk-formatted KBOI 670 AM. A new translator, K237HA 95.3 in Nampa, became the new FM home for KTIK's programming, while the original 1350 AM signal remained unchanged.\n\nThis change resulted in a significantly smaller geographic coverage area compared to the previous 93.1 FM signal, with the primary motivation being to address interference issues, particularly from power lines affecting the AM signal.\n\nKTIK operates from studios located at 1419 W. Bannock Street in downtown Boise, with call-in numbers 208-424-1350 and 1-866-296-1350. The station currently airs sports talk programming as an Infinity Sports Network affiliate under Cumulus Media ownership.\n\nThe station has embraced modern technology, offering streaming through Amazon Alexa with the skill 'Sports Radio the Ticket Boise,' allowing listeners to access programming through smart speakers and digital platforms.\n\nKTIK maintains active community involvement through various initiatives including the Boise State football women's football clinic, Hero Care, Toys for Tots, and Kids' Fair events. The station serves as the exclusive radio voice of Idaho Steelheads hockey, providing comprehensive coverage of the team's season.\n\nBeyond talk programming, KTIK serves as the exclusive radio voice of Idaho Steelheads hockey, while maintaining strong community involvement through various local initiatives including Boise State football women's clinics, Hero Care, Toys for Tots, and Kids' Fair events.\n\nIn recent years, KTIK has expanded its digital presence through partnerships, including a collaboration with Bronco Nation News that features live streaming of studio segments and cross-promotion of Boise State content. This partnership includes weekly appearances by Mallory and Prater on digital shows, providing additional platforms for sports coverage beyond traditional radio broadcasting."
