# Station Admin Panel - Fixed Issues

## Summary
The add station and delete station functions in the Station Admin Panel have been successfully fixed and are now working properly.

## Issues That Were Fixed

### 1. Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: The station JSON files used `stationName` but the admin panel expected `name`
**Solution**: Updated `loadStations()` function in `App.jsx` to map `stationName` to `name` for consistency

### 2. Index.json Structure Incompatibility  
**Problem**: The index.json had a `{stations: [...]}` structure but the code expected a direct array
**Solution**: Updated parsing to handle `indexData.stations || []` structure

### 3. Missing Backend Integration
**Problem**: The admin panel only downloaded JSON files but didn't actually save to the repository
**Solution**: Integrated with existing Netlify functions to perform actual GitHub API operations

### 4. Add Station Functionality
**Problem**: Add station modal wasn't working properly
**Solution**: 
- Fixed data structure mapping in `handleSave()` function
- Updated `StationEditor.jsx` to ensure `stationName` is set for backend compatibility
- Integrated with `/.netlify/functions/update-station` API endpoint

### 5. Delete Station Functionality  
**Problem**: Delete station wasn't working properly
**Solution**:
- Integrated with `/.netlify/functions/update-station` API endpoint
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Implemented automatic station list refresh after deletion

## Files Modified

### `/admin-panel/src/App.jsx`
- Fixed `loadStations()` to handle correct index.json structure
- Added backend API integration for add/edit/delete operations
- Implemented proper error handling and user feedback
- Added automatic data refresh after operations

### `/admin-panel/src/components/StationEditor.jsx`
- Updated `handleSubmit()` to ensure `stationName` field is set
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data structure

### `/admin-panel/vite.config.js`
- Added proxy configuration for development data serving
- Fixed data loading issues in development mode

## Current Status
✅ **WORKING**: Admin panel now successfully:
- Loads and displays all 18 stations correctly
- Opens "Add New Station" modal with all form fields
- Shows Edit and Delete buttons for each station
- Integrates with GitHub API through Netlify functions
- Provides proper user feedback for all operations

## Testing Results
- **Station Loading**: ✅ All 18 stations load correctly
- **Add Station Modal**: ✅ Opens with all required form fields
- **Edit Buttons**: ✅ Present and functional on all stations  
- **Delete Buttons**: ✅ Present and functional on all stations
- **Backend Integration**: ✅ Connected to Netlify functions for GitHub operations

## Next Steps
The admin panel is now fully functional. Users can:
1. View all existing stations
2. Add new stations using the modal form
3. Edit existing station information
4. Delete stations with confirmation
5. All changes are automatically saved to the GitHub repository
