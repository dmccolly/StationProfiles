# Delete Function Debugging Guide

## Current Status

I've added extensive debugging logs to the `handleDelete` function in `App.jsx`. The latest code has been pushed to GitHub and should automatically deploy to Netlify.

## What Changed

Added console logging to track:
1. The `stationId` parameter value when `handleDelete` is called
2. The type of `stationId` (should be "string")
3. The complete request body being sent to the backend

## Testing Steps

1. **Wait for Netlify deployment** (usually takes 2-3 minutes after push)
   - Check: https://app.netlify.com/sites/stationprofiles/deploys
   - Wait for the latest deploy to show "Published"

2. **Clear browser cache** (important!)
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
   - Or do a hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

3. **Open the admin panel with DevTools**
   - Go to: https://stationprofiles.netlify.app/admin/
   - Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
   - Click on the "Console" tab

4. **Try to delete a station**
   - Click the "Delete" button on any station
   - Confirm the deletion when prompted

5. **Check the console logs**
   - You should see these logs in order:
     ```
     handleDelete called with stationId: kawo
     Type of stationId: string
     stationId value: "kawo"
     Sending request body: {"action":"delete","stationId":"kawo"}
     ```

## What to Look For

### Scenario 1: stationId is undefined
If you see:
```
handleDelete called with stationId: undefined
Type of stationId: undefined
```

**This means:** The station object doesn't have an `id` field, or the StationList component isn't passing it correctly.

**Solution:** We need to check the station data structure.

### Scenario 2: stationId is correct but request body is wrong
If you see:
```
handleDelete called with stationId: kawo
Type of stationId: string
stationId value: "kawo"
Sending request body: {"action":"delete","stationId":"kawo"}
```

But the Netlify logs still show only `{"action":"delete"}`:

**This means:** There's an issue with how the request is being sent or received.

**Solution:** We need to investigate the network request itself.

### Scenario 3: Everything looks correct
If the console shows the correct stationId and request body, but it still fails:

**This means:** The issue is on the backend (Netlify function).

**Solution:** We need to check the Netlify function logs more carefully.

## Next Steps

After testing, please share:

1. **Browser console output** - Copy all the logs from the console
2. **Network tab details** - In DevTools, go to Network tab, find the `update-station` request, and share:
   - Request Headers
   - Request Payload
   - Response
3. **Netlify function logs** - From https://app.netlify.com/sites/stationprofiles/functions

## Quick Reference

- **Admin Panel:** https://stationprofiles.netlify.app/admin/
- **Netlify Dashboard:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/stationprofiles
- **Function Logs:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/stationprofiles/functions/update-station

## Expected Behavior

When everything works correctly:
1. Click Delete button
2. Confirm deletion
3. Console shows: "handleDelete called with stationId: [station-id]"
4. Console shows: "Sending request body: {"action":"delete","stationId":"[station-id]"}"
5. Network request sends the complete body
6. Netlify function receives both action and stationId
7. Station is deleted from GitHub
8. Station list refreshes without the deleted station
9. Success message appears

## Common Issues

### Issue: Old cached version
**Symptom:** No console logs appear
**Fix:** Hard refresh with `Ctrl+F5` or clear cache completely

### Issue: Deployment not complete
**Symptom:** Changes don't appear
**Fix:** Wait for deployment to finish, check Netlify dashboard

### Issue: Browser blocking requests
**Symptom:** Network errors in console
**Fix:** Check browser console for CORS or network errors
